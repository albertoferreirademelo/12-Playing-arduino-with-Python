# Interaction between Arduino and Python
This project was for the university where the goal was to use sensors and electronics. My project was done through a light absorber and a laser and when someone passed through the laser, the computer started to play some music. 

The project was made possible through many sensors and an interaction between Arduino programming and Python programming, which was quite interessting.
